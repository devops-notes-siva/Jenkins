 unit testing
unit testing is about testing the functions, which are basic blocks of programming. Only developers has to do unit testing...

scanning:
---
coding standars --> dev, qa, uat
Static source code analysis --> scan the code, give some recommendations
you must apply the recommendations to pass

security:
---------
SAST --> security related things, analysis will be given to developers they have to fix
DAST --> dynamic security
Open source libraries scan --> libraries scan.. frequently upgrade the libraries
docker image scan --> 
now deploy the code to development

then perform functional testing, developers can take care...
integration testing --> test the entire functionality. this will be performed by QA

-------------
unit tests
scans
	static source code analysis --> simple code scan
	SAST --> static application security testing --> security scan in the code
	open source library scan --> scan the dependencies
        for libra scanning we will setiup in github only
        repo -> secutity -> code scanning -> confiure -> tools -> codeQL analysis: default -> 
        depenbot -> scans the dependencies, here vulnarabilities
	DAST --> real time attack on the application, ttol -> veracode
	image scan
Deploy to DEV
functional tests --> usually by developers, because it is a microservice

overall code, new code
1 year code = overall code
5.3.0, 5.4.0
5.4.0-5.3.0 = new code
unit test --> functions
10 functions --> 100% coverage --> unit tests for 10 functions
80% code should be covered through unit testing

quality gates -> critical ratings, vulnarabilities, duplicate code, security rating

Sonarqube sanner:
----------------
- install Sonarqube, sonar server runs on 9000 port
- install sonar agent in jenkins server, this agent scans the code and share the results to sonar server , from sonar server decision is passed to jenkins server

to setup webhook in sonar server:(need to setup in pipelone also)
-------------------------------
administration  -> configure -> web -> name:   -> URL: http://jenkins-url:8080/sonarqube-webhook/

installing sonarqube scanner/agent/cli in jenkins server:
------------------------------------------------------
1) plugin -sonarqube scanner , in jenkins server manage jenkins-> toools -> sonarqube scanner
    mange jenkins -> system ->environmnet variables check -> sonarqube installtion(name should be same as tools), server authentication token(in sonar server -> my account -> security(name: jenkis, type: global))

    mange jenkins -> credentials -> system -> global cred -> new -> secret text -> 

        note: nexus not having agent, it uses curl to post repos 





Sonarqube installation:
================
URL:  https://blog.devops.dev/how-to-install-sonarqube-on-linux-rhel-centos-57eb5893be

1)java-11 required
2)install and Setup PostgreSQL 14 Database For SonarQube
3) Disable the default PostgreSQL module once the repository is added.
4) Now, install the PostgreSQL 14 database server
5)Initialize the Postgres database.
